            <div class="col-md-8">
                <p>
                    I grew up in eighty's and ninety's with computers (286, Amiga, 486). Naturally I was fond of gaming and went into computing and programming.
                    During my college years, I coded in TI Basic on my TI-82 calculator.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Discovering computer possibilities, by exploring operating systems was my curiosity : <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BeOS" target="_blank">BeOS</a>   BeOS (now <a href="https://www.haiku-os.org" target="_blank">Haiku</a>), <a href="https://plan9.io/wiki/plan9/FAQ/index.html" target="_blank">Plan9</a>
                    With Linux, I was appealed by minimal desktop experience and windows managers : <a href="https://suckless.org/philosophy/" target="_blank">wmii, wmi, dwm</a>, and xmonad. I loved their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle" target="_blank">KISS</a> approach.
                    Thanks to this community, I learnt about Golang and Haskell.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sport was also part of my childhood. 1986 football world cup marked me, victory against Brazil and also defeat against Germany. I practice football during 10 years.
                    This team game learnt me that no player is more important than the team. I played every role but finally preferred midfield with few experience as captain.
                    Tennis was my second preferred sport. Unlike football, winning game is not timed. And you could still win a match if you gain points after points. I learnt staying focus and being confident about my personal abilities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my career, I worked in compagnies as Desktop Engineer, especially into Operating System and Application Integration with tools like sysprep, imagex and Wise Package Studio.
                    Then, my goal was to become an expert of software packaging. <a href="http://www.instedit.com/home.html" target="_blank">InstEd</a> was my preferred tooling choice.
                    It leads me to better understand underlying windows installer model. Communication with Niel Hunt, developer of InstEd, while using his tool every day, was a unique experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Scripting in VBScript and PowerShell was also a great part of my job. I went a step further into automation with <a href="https://wixtoolset.org/" target="_blank">Windows Installer XML</a>.
                    Finally, I became able to automate software integration with static packaging architecture and dynamic sources absorption.
                    That's why I decided to create my own company to spread this new way of thinking. Several clients were offshoring this activity of mass integrations to keep cost low.
                    But with Wix, you could bring integration knowledge to developers and keeps its in internal as part of development stack.
                    I realize desktop engineer was not my play field anymore and evolution toward DevOps became obvious.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next, Cloud computing reinvented our computing consumption and brought new possibilities but also new methods and behaviours.
                    Always with the same spirit, I dug Azure DevOps SDK with ARM Templates and PowerShell to build new kinds of services.
                    Coding with ReactJS, TypeScript and Python was also a great pleasure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My last mission was the opportunity to achieve a three tiers solution with Golang, React/JS and Postgresql to facilitate technical assessment of projects for cloud migration.
                    A hard but great experience to me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my personal life, with my wife we are proud parents of one boy and one little girl.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today I want to find a job with a right balance between DevOps technical stack to master, Docker, Kubernetes amongst others, and improving my programming skills, especially in Golang and Htmx.
                </p>
                <p> May the 28 2024, : <a href="https://cert.efset.org/3Aik3K" target="_blank">my EF SET score is 71</a>
